State Management and Data Fetching

- Use Zustand for state management.
- Use TanStack React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `setState`; favor derived state and memoization when possible.
- Implement validation using Zod for schema validation
